# About the game 

It's a copy of King.com [Midas Miner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhKHjad0NLY). 

- Support drag and click events.
- Swap and collapse tiles animations.
- Last 60 seconds, 5 gem colors and a score.
- Short game over animation was implemented.

# Architecture description 

To facilitate testing and to decouple different responsibilities between classes in the system several design patterns have been applied. 

The overall game architecture uses classic MVC. Some event is created in the input handler module and  it is passed to the game controller that creates a 
list of commands to apply different algorithms to the model. At the same time, the view renders the model on every game loop iteration. 

The diagram below shows the main modules in the game (In case it looked broken, try to zoom out in your editor)

Note the game has just one "state": the gameplay itself. There is no introduction screen, main menu or game over. This could have been implemented by extending
the GameController logic with a FSM (Finite state machine) using **state pattern**. The state would be changed based on the events generated by the input. The current GameController
implementation could have been moved to a "GameplayState" class.

The view also would have been extended with several "View classes" to render these different states. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
# Main classes description 

##  Controller classes 

**GameController**: Executes sequentially a list of commands created by CommandFactory. This command list depends on how the event (ClickEvent, DragEvent,
   GameOverEvent...) is expected to interact with the model.

**RemoveCommand**: Marks as broken three or more consecutive tiles with the same color. It is implemented using a generalization of std::adjacent_first.

**CreateAndMoveCommandCommand**: Given a board where some tiles has been already removed, it collapses the tiles above the ones removed and create new ones. It uses std::stable_partition
  to perform the collapse operation.

**SwapCommand**: Given two coordinates from an input event swaps two items on the board.

**MoveCommand**: Given the coordinates from an input event and a tile, it moves the tile coordinates and updates the board to the given position.

**CollapseCommand**: Combines RemoveCommand and CreateAndMoveCommandCommand to implement the logic of creating and removing tiles after an user action that collapsed some of the tiles in the board.

##  View classes 

**GameView**: Renders every component in the model with almost zero logic.  

##  Model classes 

**GameModel**: A set of model/structs that contains data to be changed by the different commands.
